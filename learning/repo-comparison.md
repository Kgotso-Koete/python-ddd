## Scorecard

| Criterion | Option 1: `clean-architecture` | Option 2: `python-ddd` | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. DDD** | ✅ Entities, Value Objects, Events | ✅✅ Entities, VOs, Events, Aggregates, Business Rules, Domain Services | **python-ddd** |
| **2. Clean Architecture** | ✅ Layers separated across packages | ✅✅ Layers separated + CQRS (Command/Query separation) | **python-ddd** |
| **3. Framework** | Flask | FastAPI | Tie (you're OK with FastAPI) |
| **4. DDD Elements** | ⚠️ No explicit UoW, no business rules, no aggregate roots | ✅✅ UoW via TransactionContext, BusinessRules, AggregateRoots, Repositories, Events, Domain Services | **python-ddd** |
| **5. Maintainability** | ✅ Small but fragmented across 8+ packages | ✅✅ Clean monorepo with `modules/` + `seedwork/` | **python-ddd** |
| **6. TDD/Testing** | ✅ 13 test files, 1299 lines, but tests are scattered | ✅✅ Tests co-located per layer (domain/application/infrastructure), marked `@pytest.mark.unit` | **python-ddd** |
| **7. WhatsApp-ready use cases** | ⚠️ 4 use cases, no ownership tracking | ✅ More use cases with ownership, but still auction-domain specific | **python-ddd** |
| **8. UI readiness** | ⚠️ Flask templates bolted on, fragile | ⚠️ No UI at all, but clean API layer makes adding one straightforward | Tie |
| **9. Feature comprehensiveness** | ⚠️ Missing ownership, incomplete payments, stub shipping | ✅ Seller/Buyer roles, listing lifecycle (draft→publish→bid→cancel), IAM | **python-ddd** |
| **10. Code organisation/scaffolding** | ⚠️ 8 separate pip packages, complex inter-dependencies | ✅✅ Single `src/` with clear `modules/` and reusable `seedwork/` | **python-ddd** |

**Score: python-ddd wins 7/10 criteria, ties 2, loses 0.**

## Detailed Analysis

### Where `python-ddd` excels

#### 1. Explicit DDD Building Blocks (`seedwork/`)
This is the biggest differentiator. `python-ddd` provides reusable base classes you can learn from and reuse across any project:

| Building Block | `python-ddd` | `clean-architecture` |
|---|---|---|
| `Entity` base class | ✅ `entities.py` | ❌ Ad-hoc |
| `AggregateRoot` | ✅ With event collection | ❌ Mixed into entity |
| `ValueObject` (`Money`, `Email`) | ✅ `value_objects.py` | ✅ Exists but scattered |
| `BusinessRule` | ✅ `rules.py` with `is_broken()` pattern | ❌ Rules are hardcoded in entities |
| `GenericRepository` | ✅ `repository.py` with Identity Map | ✅ Exists but basic |
| `TransactionContext` (UoW) | ✅ `application/__init__.py` | ❌ Implicit in Flask hooks |
| CQRS (Command/Query) | ✅ Separate Command & Query handlers | ❌ Not implemented |
| `DataMapper` | ✅ Explicit entity↔model mapping | ❌ Inline in repository |
| `DomainEvent` + `IntegrationEvent` | ✅ Both, with event bus | ⚠️ Domain events only |

#### 2. Real Business Rules
`python-ddd` has **named, testable business rules** as first-class objects:

```python
# python-ddd: Rules are explicit, named, testable
class ListingCanBeCancelled(BusinessRule):
    def is_broken(self) -> bool:
        return not (self.time_left > 12h or no_bids)

# clean-architecture: Rules are buried in entity methods
def end_auction(self):
    if not self._should_end:
        raise AuctionHasNotEnded  # Rule is implicit
```

#### 3. Ownership & Authorization
`python-ddd` tracks **who owns what**:
- `Listing.seller_id` — tracks the owner
- `OnlyListingOwnerCanPublishListing` — enforces authorization as a business rule
- `OnlyListingOwnerCanDeleteListing` — same pattern

`clean-architecture` has **no ownership** — anyone can close any auction.

#### 4. Richer Use Cases
`python-ddd` has a more complete lifecycle:
- Create listing draft → Edit → Publish → Bid → Retract bid → Cancel listing
- Seller restrictions ("new sellers can only list 1 item")
- Automatic bidding (eBay-style proxy bidding)

#### 5. Tests Are Exemplary
The `test_bidding.py` file is a masterclass in domain testing:
- Tests are **pure domain logic** — no database, no framework
- Each test has a clear business scenario name
- Tests verify **business rules** by asserting exceptions
- Tests are co-located with the layer they test (`tests/domain/`, `tests/application/`, `tests/infrastructure/`)

### Where `clean-architecture` has strengths

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Payments module** | Has a working `PaymentsFacade` with `charge()` and `get_pending_payments()` |
| **Email notifications** | Has `customer_relationship` module with email templates for auction events |
| **Background tasks** | Uses Redis + RQ for async event handlers after DB commit |
| **Working UI** | Has Flask templates (though fragile) |

> **Note:** These are all infrastructure concerns, not domain architecture. They're useful but can be added to any project.

### Where both repos fall short for your goals

| Gap | Impact on your goals |
|---|---|
| **No WhatsApp integration** | Neither has it — you'll need to build this as a new "delivery mechanism" (like the API layer) |
| **Auction domain ≠ Truck hiring** | You'll need to rewrite the domain layer for your business. The architecture/scaffolding transfers, the domain code doesn't |
| **`python-ddd` has no UI** | You'll need to add a web frontend. But its clean API layer makes this easier than retrofitting `clean-architecture`'s Flask templates |
| **`python-ddd` payments are out of scope** | The README explicitly says "payments are out of scope" |

## Recommendation: Use `python-ddd` as your learning foundation

### Why it's the right choice for you specifically

1. **You said "I need actual code as infrastructure"** — `python-ddd`'s `seedwork/` IS that infrastructure. Copy it into any new project and you have Entity, AggregateRoot, Repository, BusinessRule, UoW, CQRS all ready to go.

2. **You said "I don't want toy examples"** — `python-ddd`'s bidding system implements real eBay-style automatic bidding with time-based cancellation rules. These are the kind of business rules you'll encounter in truck hiring (e.g., "can only cancel a booking if pickup is > 12 hours away").

3. **You said "I'm not experienced enough to fill gaps"** — `python-ddd` has fewer gaps. The `seedwork` gives you the building blocks; the `modules/` show you how to use them. `clean-architecture` leaves you guessing about UoW, business rules, and aggregate boundaries.

4. **FastAPI > Flask for WhatsApp** — FastAPI's async support is better suited for WhatsApp webhook handling where you need non-blocking I/O. Flask would require additional setup (Celery/RQ) for what FastAPI handles natively.

### Concrete action plan

1. **Week 1**: Study `seedwork/` — understand Entity, AggregateRoot, BusinessRule, Repository, TransactionContext
2. **Week 2**: Study `modules/bidding` — trace a full use case from API route → Command → Handler → Domain → Repository → DB
3. **Week 3**: Create `modules/truck_hiring` with your domain (Orders, Trucks, Companies, Bookings)
4. **Week 4**: Add `src/whatsapp/` as a delivery mechanism alongside `src/api/`, using the same Commands/Queries

> **Tip:** The key insight of Clean Architecture is that **WhatsApp and Web are just different delivery mechanisms**. They both call the same `Commands` and `Queries`. Your domain doesn't care if the user typed "Book truck" in WhatsApp or clicked a button on a webpage.

## Post-Comparison: Ideas to Borrow from `clean-architecture`

While `python-ddd` is the better base, `clean-architecture` successfully implements several advanced DDD concepts that should be ported over:

1. **Process Managers (Sagas):** The `clean-architecture` repo uses an elegant Saga (`processes/paying_for_won_item`) to coordinate multi-module workflows asynchronously. This prevents the `Auctions` module from being tightly coupled to the `Payments` module.
2. **The Outbox Pattern & Background Workers:** By using `db_infrastructure/outbox.py` and a background queue (Redis/RQ), it processes slow side-effects (like sending emails) outside the main HTTP transaction, keeping API responses lightning fast.
3. **Strict Physical Boundaries:** Each module in `clean-architecture` has its own `setup.py`, making them separate, installable Python packages. This forces absolute architectural decoupling at the Python interpreter level, whereas `python-ddd` currently relies on developer discipline.
4. **Explicit Facades:** It uses strict interfaces (e.g., `PaymentsFacade`) when modules must communicate synchronously, hiding all internal module complexities.
